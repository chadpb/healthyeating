Some popular forms of effective exercise include cardiovascular activities like running, cycling, or swimming for improving endurance, strength training with weights or bodyweight exercises for building muscle, and flexibility exercises like yoga or stretching to improve mobility. It's important to choose activities that you enjoy and that align with your fitness goals to make your exercise routine sustainable in the long term.
