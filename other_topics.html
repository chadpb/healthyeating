            People often use the terms "physical activity" and "exercise" interchangeably, but they have different meanings. “Physical activity” refers to any body movement that burns calories, whether for work or play, going to the gym, daily chores, or the daily commute. “Exercise,” a subcategory of physical activity, refers to planned, structured, and repetitive activities aimed at improving physical fitness and health.This is important to know that you can be physically active without going to the gym. Making your bed, doing the dishes or laundry, or even vacuuming count as a form of physical activity. Exercise is a bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness. Insufficient physical activity is the most common health issue in the world. Staying physically active can help prevent or delay certain diseases, including some cancers, stroke, hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes, and can also relieve depression and improve mood

            For health benefits, 2.5 hours of moderate-intensity exercise per week is recommended for reducing the risk of health issues.At the same time, even doing a small amount of exercise is healthier than doing none. Already doing an hour and a quarter (11 minutes/day) of exercise could reduce the risk of early death, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and cancer.

            Some of the benefits of physical activity on brain health happen right after a session of moderate to vigorous physical activity. Benefits include: improved thinking or cognition for children ages 6-13, short-term reduction of anxiety for adults, and enhanced functional capacity in older adults.[9] Regular physical activity can keep thinking, learning, and judgment skills sharp with age. It can also reduce the risk of depression and anxiety and improve sleep.
